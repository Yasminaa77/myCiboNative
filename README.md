## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have Expo CLI working on your development machine, and have installed the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS physical device or emulator/simulator.
You can install Expo CLI using yarn or npm.
- If you prefer using Yarn, run either ```yarn global add expo-cli``` or ```yarn add expo-cli```.
- If you prefer using npm, run either ```npm install expo-cli --global``` or ```npm install expo-cli```.

### Installation

To set up the Expo environment with React Native, follow these steps:
- Install ngrok with ```brew install ngrok```.
- Install @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0 with ```npm i @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0```.
- Set up a secure HTTPS tunnel using ngrok with ```ngrok http 3000```. Make sure to run it to check that the session is online.
- Start Expo with ```expo start --tunnel```.\
